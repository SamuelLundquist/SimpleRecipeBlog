# SimpleRecipeBlog
Simple recipe blog website from tutorial by **RaddyTheBrand** on Youtube with my own twist. It uses Node.js, Express, EJS, mongoose and MongoDB to provide a streamlined browsing experience, allowing you to browse community made recipes and share your own.

I styled the website with bootstrap and icons from font awesome. Deployed the app to heroku with the login for MongoDB as an environment variable.

## Result
You can find this website hosted at: https://nodejs-recipe-blog.herokuapp.com/

**Please keep in mind that anything can be added to this site, by anyone. I am not actively monitoring its content and if you do find anything unprofessional on there, I apologize. If this occurs, please let me know so I can remove it.**

## Try on your own
If you wish to try out this web app locally, you will need to provide a MongoDB database: https://www.mongodb.com/

More info about how that is set up can be found in **RaddyTheBrand**'s tutorial.
